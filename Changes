0.102 Fri, August 21, 2009 12:52:07 -0500
  * [New] Net::SAJAX has a new attribute "autoclean_garbage" that when set
    will attempt to clean garbage from a SAJAX response due to bad server
    programming.
  * [API change] Exceptions are no longer strings, but objects. The objects
    will stringify to their former string representation.
