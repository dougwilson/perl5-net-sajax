Net::SAJAX::VersionGuarantee - Information regarding module version numbering

=head1 VERSION NUMBER FORMAT

This module has a version number that is guaranteed to be in the following
format: C<< m{\A \d+ \. \d{3} \z}msx >>. Please see L<perlre> for information
on the regular expression format.

  my ($major_version, $minor_version) = $Net::SAJAX::VERSION
    =~ m{\A (\d+) \. (\d{3}) \z}msx;

=head1 MAJOR VERSION CHANGE

When the major version number changes (that is, the number to the left of the
decimal point) it is almost guaranteed that there is breakage in the public
API.
